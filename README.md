![alt text](Images/ClassificationGraph.png)

## Introduction
The purpose of this project is to use a knowledge base to classify learning disabilities. The knowledge base is a graph that contains information about learning disabilities and their symptoms. The graph is used to classify learning disabilities based on the symptoms that a person exhibits. The project uses a rule-based system to classify learning disabilities based on the symptoms that a person exhibits. The project also uses a knowledge base to provide information about learning disabilities and their symptoms. The project is implemented in Python using the NetworkX library to create and manipulate the graph.

## Method of Classification
I will ask questions
and allow the user to input answers on a scale of 1 to 5 with 5 being maximum agreement and 1 being minimum agreement.
The questions will be based on the symptoms of learning disabilities.
The answers will be used to classify the learning disability based on the symptoms that the user exhibits.
The classification will be done
using a rule-based system
that uses the knowledge base to determine the learning disability based on the symptoms that the user exhibits.
The questions will be weighted and diagnoses
will be made based on the answers provided by the user if they reach certain thresholds.
